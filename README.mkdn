### Description ###

This bash script is used to build crDroid and upload via FTP.  
With proper settings, it's also possible to push to crDroid AFH page automatically.

### How to Install

In order to install this, all it's needed to be done is copy build script locally, set it as executable and configure it with built-in wizard.  
To do so run following commands in terminal:

```bash
# Download the script with curl
$ curl -LJO https://raw.githubusercontent.com/crdroidandroid/crdroid_build/9.0/build
# Make script executable
$ chmod +x build
# run the script
$ ./build
```

### Configuration

You now need to configure build script and add device codenames that you want to build for.  
For that just issue **./build** in terminal and follow the on-screen instructions.

```bash
$ ./build
$ Please enter the path where crDroid folder is located (full path ex:/home/<user>/crDroid)
$ /home/gwolf2u/crDroid
$ How much RAM can JACK use for compiling? (numeric value ex: 16)
$ 16
$ How much space (in GB) can be used to ccache? (numeric value ex: 30)
$ 30
$ Copy changelog to script location at end of compilation?
$ 1 or 2 (Yes/No)
$ Upload compilation to FTP at end of build?
$ 1 or 2 (Yes/No)
$ Enter FTP hostname (ex: uploads.androidfilehost.com):
$ uploads.androidfilehost.com
$ Enter FTP username:
$ gwolf2u
$ Enter FTP password:
$ myultrasecurepassword
```

Now as you just set your configuration, next step would be to add a devices to initiate build for.  
Running **./build add** will prompt you to enter your device information.  

```bash
$ ./build add
$ Add a new device:
$ Format: <device codename>,<FTP upload path>
$ mako,auto/Nexus4/crDroid
```

**FTP upload path** - ask crDroid staff via our Telegram channel for this path according to your device (this is useful for auto import to AFH).

### Additional stuff (optional and not mandatory)

If you want to run some additional commands before build starts, for example, repopick some unmerged commits, just create a commands.txt file, and add your stuff there.
This way the build script picks up the files and executes the commands line by line (see commands.txt example).

### Start building

In order to start building, issue the following command in terminal

    $ ./build

### Help

Issue **./build help** in terminal for a list of helpfull commands
